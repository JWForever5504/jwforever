Hello there!

My online name is JWForever5504 and my YouTube channel is [channel_name](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW_dsmLJe5dIrVw34y9IOew). I love animals, and am a massive Star Wars fan, as well as an obessive programmer. I've taught myself JSON and Javascript over the past 3 years, and now I am using it to help others enjoy the game more!

Check out some of my maps and add-ons available for download!
